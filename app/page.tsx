        {`I'm a first-generation college student graduating this December
        with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a degree in Cybersecurity. 
        My technical skills come from school projects where I've developed 
        software and solved complex problems. Through my role as a Peer Mentor 
        at the Dream Success Center, which supports undocumented students, 
        Iâ€™ve sharpened my communication and teamwork abilities, working closely 
        with others in a collaborative setting.

        This blog showcases my projects, skills, and passion for technology 
        as I seek opportunities to connect with companies that value innovation 
        and diversity. I'm eager to contribute my expertise while growing as a 
        developer and cybersecurity specialist.
